## Example R packages

* [MyNewPackage](https://github.com/RWorkflow-Workshop-2021/MyNewPackage) The package I made during class. You can also open on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2574138) and build it from there.
* [VRData](https://nwfsc-math-bio.github.io/VRData/) This is the data package that I spent the most time on in lecture.
* [many NOAA examples](https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes/.github/wiki/02-GitHub-in-Government#github-in-noaa--nmfs)
