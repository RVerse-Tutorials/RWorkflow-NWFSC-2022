## Questions from the post-lecture chat

* I didn't show how to compare branches. [Show me in GitHub Desktop](https://youtu.be/JFUeF3cqccw)
* A more complicated example of updating a branch and dealing with a merge conflict [Show me in GitHub Desktop](https://youtu.be/uu92kFnp7iw)
* Discard changes that you have saved but not committed yet. [Show me in GitHub Desktop](https://youtu.be/DokyxU8ORWc) - [Show me in VS Code](https://youtu.be/mz-ywBzW5ow) - [Show me in RStudio/shell](https://youtu.be/3J2PlxaBbBE)
* I added another example that of something you need to know before working with branches: work you haven't committed yet behaves differently!

The default behavior is that any changes you have not committed will **follow** you when you change branches. This will through you for a loop if you don't know about this. GitHub Desktop will alert you and default is that these changes do **not** follow, but in every other GUI, they follow without warning.
