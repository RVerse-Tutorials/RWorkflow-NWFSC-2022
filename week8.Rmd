## More R packaging

* [The lecture notes](week8-adv-packages.html)

## Q & A

I added more links to the lecture notes from the chat:

* **profvis** package

Check out the [**profvis**](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/) for profiling your code. I haven't used it but others have said it's a great tool.

* **magrittr** 2.0!

The new version is much faster. [Read about it here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/11/magrittr-2-0-is-here/)

* R 4.1 has a native pipe

It's a little different than the `%>%` pipe is denoted `|>`. [Read about R 4.1 here](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/new-features-r410-pipe-anonymous-functions/).
