This week I will give an introduction to plotting with the **ggplot2** package. Getting a basic familiarity with **ggplot2** will really save you a lot of time that you spend futzing with plots. 

This is oriented to those with little or no experience using **ggplot2** or those who have tried it and gotten frustrated. If you already use **ggplot2**, you won't find this session very interesting.  The goal of this session is to get you started. Once you have the basics, there are a gazillion ggplot tutorials online (though personally the basics are all I need).

You can [clone my Week 5 repository](https://github.com/RWorkflow-Workshop-2021/Week5) or open the respository in R Studio Cloud and work from there.


If you are working on your own computer, you will need to install the **ggplot2** and **gridExtra** packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
```


# Basic xy plot

## Workflow

Let's say you wanted to make a simple xy plot with `plot()`. Here's your workflow.

* Decide on `x` or use the default (1 to the number of data points).
* Decide on `y`.
* Plot with `plot(x,y)`

```{r}
val <- mtcars$mpg
x <- mtcars$hp
plot(x, val, type="p")
```


Here's your `ggplot()` workflow.

* Decide on `x` or use the default (1 to the number of data points).
* Decide on `y`.
* Make a data frame with `x` and `y`.
* Create the plot object with a call to `ggplot()` to tell it the data frame and then what the `x` and `y` to use. The latter is with  `aes()` (aesthestics).
* Add points or lines to the plot with `geom_line()` or `geom_point()`.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x=mtcars$hp, val=mtcars$mpg)
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) #set up data and x and y
p2 <- p1 + geom_point() # Tell it what to do with that (add a line)
p2 # plot it
```

Typically you'd just write the call like so
```
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + geom_point()
```
But I assigned the calls to objects `p1` and `p2` so you can see that both are ggplot objects.
```{r}
class(p1)
class(p2)
```
That feature is going to be super helpful because it means you can easily add elements to a ggplot without worrying about `y` axis limits or figure sizing.
```{r}
p2 + geom_line()
```

# Modifying your plot

## Points and lines

With `plot()`, you alter the points and lines with arguments passed to `plot()`.

* `pch` (point type), `lty` (linetype), `type` ("l", "b", "p"), `lwd` (line width), `cex` (point size)

```{r}
plot(x, val, type="b", lwd=2, lty=2,
     pch=21, col="red", cex=4, bg="blue")
```

With `ggplot()`, the approach is quite different and the names are mostly totally different. A cheatsheet of things you commonly use will be helpful when start (I still use one).

There are two different workflows that you need to decide on.

1. *Dynamic colors etc*: Let `ggplot()` pick your colors, points, line widths etc.
2. *Fixed colors etc*: Manually choose your colors, points, line widths etc, aka use a fixed value.

Gravitating to option 1 will make your life with `ggplot()` easier, but let's start with option 2.

![Important](images/Emblem-important-red.svg.png)
*Fixed* lines, points attributes go *outside* of `aes()` in a `geom_...()` call. *Dynamic* attributes go *inside* of `aes()`.


Look at `?geom_point` to see the attributes that you can pass in.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + geom_point(col="blue")
```

The length of the fixed attribute must be 1 or the length of the data.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + 
  geom_point(shape=21, col="blue", fill=mtcars$carb, size=6, alpha=.5, stroke=2)
```

Ways to set attributes that won't work as you think:

Putting color outside of `aes()` in `ggplot()` does nothing. `ggplot()` sets up the data to use, but information outside `aes()` doesn't flow to the plotting functions like `geom_point()`.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val), col="blue") + geom_point()
```

Putting color inside of `aes()` in `ggplot()` has a non-intuitive effect. Plot attributes, like color, in `aes()` are converted to factors and the colors (etc) will be choosen dynamically. The name "blue" is not a color is the a factor and `ggplot()` gives the first factor the color red in this case. Information in `aes()` will *flow* to the rest of the plot unless you tell the `geom_point()` otherwise).

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val, color="blue")) + geom_point()
```

How do we *tell* `geom_point()` not to use the color value in `aes()` in `ggplot()`?  Tell it to use a fixed value by putting `col="blue"` outside of an `aes()` call in `geom_point()`.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + geom_point(col="blue")
```

What happens if we put the color in `aes()` in `geom_point()`?
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + geom_point(aes(color="blue"))
```

Let's make a plot with big red points and a thick blue line.
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) + 
  geom_line(col="blue", size=2) +
  geom_point(col="red", size=3)
p1
```

Let's add a column plot to that. I pass in `alpha` to add some transparency to the columns so they don't wipe out the line.
```{r}
p1 + geom_col(alpha=0.5, position="dodge")
```

## Labels and limits

With `plot()`, you alter the labels and limits with arguments passed to `plot()`.

* `xlab` and `ylab` (labels), `mail` (title), `ylim` and `xlim` (limits)

```{r}
plot(x, val, type="p", xlab="time", ylab="value",
     xlim=c(100,200), ylim=c(0,40), main="plot plot")
```

With `ggplot`, it's pretty similar but you use functions. Ignore the NA warning. I'll show how to stop that later. ggplot likes to gives warnings about things that it knows how to deal with.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=val)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("time") + ylab("value") +
  ggtitle("ggplot plot") +
  xlim(c(100,200)) + ylim(c(0,40))
```

# Changing the whole look

ggplot uses themes to set the look of your plot and you can change the whole look by setting a different theme. You can also just tweak one element of the plot's existing theme. Note because we fixed the line and point colors, we override some theme elements (eg, line colors). See `?theme_bw` to see all the themes. See `?theme` to learn how to change one element of your plot design.

```{r}
p1 + theme_classic()
```

# Adding lines or points

Let's say you want to plot 2 lines.

## Workflow

In `plot()` your workflow is

* Define `x1` and `x2` (if different)
* Define `y1` and `y2`
* Plot `y1` *with limits adjusted for the data we are adding*.
* Add `y2` to the plot.

```{r}
val2 <- val+10
plot(x, val, ylim=c(0,50))
lines(x[order(x)], val2[order(x)])
```

In `ggplot()` you have two possible workflows. First one could be like the `plot()` workflow. This will cause you problems if you later want to arrange these data into separate plots, but lets go ahead and do this. Sometimes this is the easiest way to get done what you need to do.

* Define `x1` and `x2` (if different)
* Define `y1` and `y2`
* Make data frames `df` and `df2` for both.
* Set up the plot with `ggplot()` and `df`
* Add points with `geom_point()`
* Add `df2` using `geom_line()` with `df2` passed in and `aes()` call.

How `aes()` is working. `aes()` information is flowing rightward. Everything to the right will inherit the data frame and `aes()` info unless you specifiy new data or new `aes()`.

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(x=x, val2=val+10)
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=x, y=val)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=val2))
```

This *inheriting* feature of `aes()` is great but can get you mixed up when you are layering data like this. Here I made a typo and used `val` instead of `val2` for y in the line. `ggplot` *helped* me out by using the data from `df` instead.
```{r}
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=x, y=val)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=val))
```

Usually it is clearer if you keep the data and `aes()` with the points and lines. Note data and `aes()` will still inherit rightward.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=df, aes(x=x, y=val)) +
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=val2))
```

Here is another example of plotting data from two different data frames:
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) +
  geom_bar(data=mtcars, aes(x=cyl), alpha=0.3) +
  ylab("y") + xlab("x")
```


## Adding a legend

ggplot makes it rather hard to modify your legend if you create a plot this way. Creating a manual legend, as opposed to dynamically as ggplot is supposed to work, can be quite hacky. First thing to know is that the color, linestyle, and/or shape must be in `aes()` to appear in the legend. If it's not there you can't control it in the legend. 

Note: What I am about to show *is really hacky and not the way ggplot is intended to be used,* but it comes up so often for new ggplot users that I want you to see a solution so you don't give up on ggplot because of legends. Jump ahead to the correct ggplot workflow with long-form data frames to see how to avoid this.

This works. Ignore the warning about unknown aesthetics. Once again ggplot loves to warn about non-problems.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=df, aes(x=x, y=val, col="df", linetype="df")) +
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=val2, col="df2", linetype="df2")) +
  scale_color_manual("name", values=c("blue", "black")) +
  scale_linetype_manual("name",values=c(0,1))
```

# Better ggplot workflow

This is how `ggplot()` is intended to be used

* Make data frames with `df` and `df2` data and a "name" column.
* Set up the plot with `ggplot()`
* Make points or line different using the "name" column

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x=x, val=val, name="df1")
df2 <- data.frame(x=x, val=val+10, name="df2")
df3 <- rbind(df1, df2)
ggplot(df3, aes(x=x, y=val, col=name, shape=name)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## Notes

* If the color, shape, linetype is not in an `aes()` it won't appear in the legend. 
* `aes()` info in `ggplot()` flows to the other elements. Put the `aes()` info in the individual `geom_...()` calls if you don't want that.
* Want to mix points and lines? You need to use `scale_..._manual()` to manually turn-off points of lines for some of the data.
* You can always force colors, shapes, linetypes by passing in color, shape, size etc outside of `aes()` but it won't appear in the legend.

Example, points are all black since the `aes(col=name)` only appears in the `geom_line()` call.
```{r}
ggplot(df3, aes(x=x, y=val)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col=name)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=name))
```

## Modifying the legend

You can control all aspects of the legend. Read up on it [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/).

Making some data points and other lines will require `scale_...()` and gets hacky.

```{r}
ggplot(df3, aes(x=x, y=val)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col=name, linetype=name)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=name)) +
  scale_color_manual("name", values=c("blue", "black")) +
  scale_shape_manual("name",values=c(NA,1)) +
  scale_linetype_manual("name",values=c(1,0))
```

## NA warnings

Ack all those NA warnings!
```{r}
df4 <- data.frame(x=1:10, y=c(1,NA,NA,4:10), name=rep(c("a","b"),5))
ggplot(df4, aes(x=x, y=y, col=name)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Get rid of them using `na.rm=TRUE`.
```{r}
ggplot(df4, aes(x=x, y=y, col=name)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)
```

# Arranging plots into grids

## Manually

Let's do a 4x4 grid of plots with `plot()`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
t <- 1:10
val <- rnorm(10)
plot(t, val, type="b")
plot(t, val+100, type="l")
plot(t, 100*val, type="p")
barplot(1:4, 1:4, type="b")
```

Now let's do this in with `ggplot()` in a similar workflow. The difference with `ggplot()` is that we save the plots and then arrange them into a grid with `gridExtra::grid.arrange()` (from the gridExtra package).

Let's do a 4x4 grid of plots with `plot()`.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
df <- data.frame(t = 1:10, val = rnorm(10))
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=t, y=val)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=t, y=val+100)) + geom_line()
p3 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=t, y=100*val)) + geom_point()
df2 <- data.frame(t = 1:4, val = 1:4, se=.1*(1:4))
p4 <- ggplot(df2, aes(x=t, y=val)) + geom_col()
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4)
```

Let's do two plots in one column but add new info to plot 1.

```{r}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1+geom_smooth(method="lm"), 
                        p4+geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=val-se, ymax=val+se), width=0.3), ncol=1)
```

## Dynamically

ggplot will also dynamically break your data into plots for you.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(t=t, val=val, name="df1")
df2 <- data.frame(t=t, val=val+1, name="df2")
df <- rbind(df1, df2)
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=t, y=val, col=name)) + geom_line()
p1
```

```{r}
p1 + facet_wrap(~name)
```

```{r}
head(mpg)
```

Let's plot city mpg versus number of cylinders.
```{r}
pc <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=cty)) + geom_point()
pc
```

Now we can divide this up by different factors in our the mpg data frame.

```{r}
pc + facet_wrap(~class)
```

We can add some things to our plot and free the scales.

```{r}
pc + facet_wrap(~class, scales="free") + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

Another nice feature is that we can combine these wrapped figures into a grid because they are ggplot objects. Making this plot in base R would take you forever and another 2 forever is you wanted to change it around or if the number of classes in your data changed.

```{r}
pf <- pc + facet_wrap(~class)
grid.arrange( p1, pf, ncol=2)
```

And I can add features to the plots right in the `grid.arrange()` call.
```{r}
pf <- pc + facet_wrap(~class)
grid.arrange(
  p1+ggtitle("All the classes"), 
  pf+theme_bw()+ylab("City mpg"),
  ncol=2)
```

## Notes

* `facet_wrap()` often balks if you use different data frames in your plot construction, i.e. you doing something kind of hacky.
    * needs a column in your data frame factors (or characters it can coerce into factors). Might work with multiple data frames in your plot as long as each data frame has the same "name" column.
    * wants all the data frame to be the same length. This is only when you use different data frames. Fine if you have all data in one data frame.

# Creating plot templates

If you are creating plots with the same features over and over, you can hold the features in a list and add that on to your plot.

Example where I want all my plots to have red points and a regression line:
```{r}
p3 <- geom_point(col="red")
p2 <- geom_smooth(method="lm")
p4 <- xlab("MPG")
p5 <- ylab("HP")
# pt is my template
pt <- list(p2, p3, p4, p5)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=hp)) + pt
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy,y=cyl)) + pt
grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

# Summary

ggplot can make your plotting workflow more efficient and much much faster. No more hassling with layouts. It takes a little while to get the hang of, but you do not need to be a ggplot wizard. Just the basics here will take you a long way. Google will answer any other questions that you have.

A good set of basic ggplot commands when you are starting:

* `ggplot`
* `geom_line()`
* `geom_point()`
* `geom_col()`
* `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `xlim()`, `ylim()`
* Themes. Use `?theme_bw` to see them.
* `gridExtra::grid.arrange(..., nrow, ncol)`
* `facet_wrap()`
* Changing the color, line, and points manually is a bit painful, but often unavoidable. Get to know the `scale_xyz_manual()` functions when you need to do that. `?scale_color_manual` to find them all.

ggplot's main downside for me is the lack of a manual legend function like `plot()`'s `legend()` and the amount of work needed to customize legends. But this is made up for in ggplot's other great features.
