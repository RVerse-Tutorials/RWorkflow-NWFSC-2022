## Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub. 

* [The lecture notes](week1-rstudio.html)
* [Lecture video](https://youtu.be/8YyNtEkKCgY) 

*Note at minute 39 or so in the video, I show how to clone a GitHub repo using RStudio. However this requires that RStudio knows where `git.exe` is. For week 2, I changed to cloning using GitHub Desktop, which doesn't require using Git in RStudio at all. So for the Git/GitHub parts, I would go to the Week 2 video.*

## Session questions and comments

* Here are some shorter videos of the workflows that I showed during Week 1.
    * Connecting GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account. [Video](https://youtu.be/AiRrSwQte5k)
    * Making a repo on GitHub and getting that into RStudio and GitHub Desktop [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPya6iDik6M)
    * Getting a repo on GitHub into RStudio Cloud. Watch the first part of the previous video if you need to see how to create a repo on GitHub. [Video](https://youtu.be/w6fivjMGZVo)
    * Connecting Git and RStudio Desktop. You can use Git inside RStudio (I do sometimes) but for 25 to 50% of people there is much suffering going this route while the set-up using GitHub Desktop is fast and easy.  [Notes](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020/set-up.html#Set_up_RStudio_to_use_Git), [Tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html), [Video overview of the steps](https://youtu.be/2QJQ6pNroVM).
    * Real workflow. This is a quick video of me working on the workshop webpage via RStudio. [Videl](https://youtu.be/8aHOrfoQICk)
    * Connecting GitHub and GitKraken. I downloaded [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) and this shows how to connect it to GitHub. [Video](https://youtu.be/_plekl0y8Rk)
    * Clone a repo from GitHub using GitKraken. [Video](https://youtu.be/axXwBEc4g0U)
    * Open a repo on your computer using GitKraken. [Video](https://youtu.be/sBxya8FjK7w)
* There was a question about how to get started organizing your code into projects when you have just a bunch of scripts. [This lecture](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020/week2-coding.html) from 2020 discusses that. Skip the GitHub stuff at the start.
