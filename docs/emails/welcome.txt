Set-up
You can just watch the lectures, but if you want to follow along you will need to get a GitHub account. Then for the software, you have 2 options

1) Install R, RStudio and GitHub Desktop on your computer.
2) Install nothing and use RStudio Cloud.

GitHub Classroom
I will be using GitHub Classroom for communications and teaching. If you want to participate actively, click this link to join the Workshop 2021 organization. Note, it is fine to just listen to the lectures but if you want to 'learn by doing', then click this link to get your first 'assignment'. There is no 'assignment'. You'll just get an invite to join the 'classroom'.
