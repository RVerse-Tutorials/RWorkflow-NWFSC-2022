This week will shift gears and talk about writing reports using markdown via Quarto (the next-gen R Markdown). There are many on-line tutorials for R Markdown which will cover the basics. I'll focus on some of the aspects that can really speed up your work: 

* automating the making of tables and figures
* duplicating tables or figures by looping over a variable
* using Work templates to change the look and formatting

AND today I will show Quarto, which fixes many of the things that were hard with R Markdown reports. Note Quarto is part of RStudio now; not a separate software that you have to install.

## Set-up

I will be using RStudio Cloud so that you can follow along [this link](https://rstudio.cloud/content/4308300). The example qmd files are in https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/QmdReport.
