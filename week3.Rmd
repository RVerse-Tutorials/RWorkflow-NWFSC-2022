## Intro to Agile and Kanban with GitHub project boards

* [lecture notes](week3-introtoagile.html) - [slides](week3-introtoagile-slides.html)
* [Lecture video](https://youtu.be/uBTzghMCDaQ)

## Session questions and comments

* There was a discussion about how to do Kanban across multiple teams each with their own boards. I think at that point, you want to start looking at something like Jira or Trello. NOAA has a Jira Enterprise licese. Contact your IT to get on that. Or try out Jira [for free with up to 10 team members](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing). Note you can connect Jira and GitHub.
